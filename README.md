Functions array, writed on Rust for creating the simplest console graphical user interface. It can create lines, rectangles, rounds (no), support work with layers: add, unite, delete. The library has great support from our "big" team every week. And now, imaging - I'm typing instructions for import in all editions here. So, why I'm wrote such stupid README - because my library isn't published. Why It isn't published - I don't now cargo yet hasn't many functions
