Functions array, writed for three languaches Python (fighting in concurention), Rust (such as Python), JavaScript (What do you think about games in browser consoleðŸ™ƒ, is it cool idea? Right?) for creating the simplest console graphical user interface. It can create lines, rectangles, rounds (no), support work with layers: add, unite, delete. The library has great support from our "big" team every week.
And now, imaging - I'm typing instructions for import in all editions here.
Some history. Once day I taked my phone, opened Termux, I wanted create functions for simple drawing banners for ~~evil exploits ðŸ˜ˆ~~ kind console programs and not only for Termux, of course. Wrote command "nano" input name and saw... didn't typed letter "n" and called file "mai.py" - "is great name for library" - tought I.
So, why I wrote such stupid README - because my library doesn't published. Why It doesn't published - because hasn't many functions.
